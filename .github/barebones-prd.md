## 4. Technical Considerations

### Architecture

The application will use a **Next.js** SSR approach for fast page loads, which enhances SEO and performance for an e-commerce site. The architecture supports scalability and can easily accommodate additional features post-MVP.

### Integrations

- **Payment Gateway**: If handling live payments, integrate a service like Stripe for seamless and secure payment handling.
- **Analytics**: Use analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, or a custom setup) to track user behavior, from landing pages to checkout, and measure KPIs.

### Scalability

- **Data Handling**: PostgreSQL is used for its robustness and scalability with Drizzle ORM to streamline database interactions.
- **State Management**: Using React Context/Zustand for cart and user state ensures a lightweight and scalable approach to managing data across the app.
- **API Communication**: tRPC will handle API communication, allowing type-safe and efficient data fetching.

### Privacy & Security

- **User Authentication**: NextAuth is implemented for secure user authentication.
- **Data Storage**: User data is encrypted in PostgreSQL with minimal personally identifiable information stored.
- **Payment Security**: If adding a payment integration, PCI compliance will be ensured by using a trusted third-party provider.

These considerations ensure a robust, secure, and maintainable foundation that can adapt to future demands and traffic.
